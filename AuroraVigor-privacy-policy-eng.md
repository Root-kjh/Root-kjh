# Privacy Policy

1. Information Collection and Use

We collect basic user information such as age, gender, current weight, target weight, and body fat percentage to set up user profiles.

Users can set their health goals (weight loss, muscle gain, fitness improvement, etc.) and target dates.

We collect health data from the Apple Watch, including activity levels, heart rate, and sleep patterns.

Users can manually input data such as weight and body fat percentage.

2. Data Usage

The collected data is used to provide personalized recommendations for exercise and to calculate an overall health score and detailed indices (stress management, energy levels, 
lifestyle balance, etc.).

The data is also used to compare the user's current exercise levels with recommended levels.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or sell user data to third parties without the user's explicit consent.

We may disclose user data if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety.

4. Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

Users are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
